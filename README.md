# Rebol [R3] Source Code Distribution

Purpose of this **Rebol fork** is to push the origial [Carl's source](https://github.com/rebol/rebol) to be usable at least like Rebol 2,
but keep the source code clean and project easy to build. Use [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) file to see changes made in this branch.

### Issues reporting

Preferred way for issue reporting is using [dedicated issue repository](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues). It's a fork of the original Rebol issue repository, which was filled with issues from [CureCode issue tracker](https://www.curecode.org/rebol3/view-tickets.rsp), which was used before Rebol was on Github. I'm not using the original Rebol issue repository, because I was not allowed to even add labels to my own issues. It was later moved under Metaeducation account and is used for Ren-C development anyway.

### Other Rebol related projects

If you are looking for other _Rebol like languages_, you may want to check also:

* [Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo) language written in Nim
* [Boron](http://urlan.sourceforge.net/boron/) language written in C
* [Red](https://github.com/red/red) language written in Red bootstrapped from Rebol2
* [Red.js](https://github.com/ALANVF/Red.js) web runtime for Red written in Haxe
* [Ren-C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c) another living Rebol3 fork

* [Topaz](https://github.com/giesse/Project-SnowBall) experimental Rebol like language being compiled to JS
* [World](https://github.com/Geomol/World) language written in C


There is also [Shinxin's fork](https://github.com/zsx/r3), which I was initially using for _chery-picking_,
as it contains modifications from Atronix and Saphirion. But its use is now limited as it depends on non-public modules and also there is not much life visible recently.
